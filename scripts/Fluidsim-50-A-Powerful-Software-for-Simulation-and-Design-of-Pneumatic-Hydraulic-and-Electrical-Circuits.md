## Fluidsim 5.0 Features
 
Fluidsim 5.0 has many features that make it a powerful and versatile software for simulation and design of pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical circuits. Some of these features are:

- It has a large library of components that covers all the common elements of pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical systems, such as valves, cylinders, motors, sensors, switches, relays, logic gates, timers, counters and more.
- It allows you to create complex circuit diagrams with ease using drag and drop, copy and paste, undo and redo functions. You can also zoom in and out, rotate and flip the components, align and distribute them, group and ungroup them, and add labels and comments.
- It simulates the behavior of the circuit in real time and shows the values of pressure, flow, voltage, current and other variables. You can also adjust the simulation speed, pause and resume the simulation, and record and replay the simulation.
- It provides animations of the components that show their movement and state changes. You can also view sectional views of the components that show their internal structure and operation. You can also watch video sequences that explain the principles and applications of the components.
- It generates reports of the simulation results that include graphs, tables, statistics and diagrams. You can also export the reports to PDF, Word or Excel formats. You can also print the reports or save them as images.
- It supports different modes of operation such as design mode, simulation mode, test mode and exam mode. You can also switch between different views such as circuit diagram view, animation view, sectional view and video view.
- It has a user-friendly interface that is easy to navigate and customize. You can also change the language, color scheme, font size and other settings of the software.

Fluidsim 5.0 is a comprehensive software that can help you learn and master the concepts and skills of pneumatic, hydraulic and electrical engineering. It can also help you design and test your own circuits and projects using realistic simulations. Fluidsim 5.0 is a must-have tool for students, teachers and professionals in the field of automation.
